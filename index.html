		  		<h2>The United-States 🇺🇸</h2>

		  		<p>
		  			When I was 16, I left France to go in a host family in the USA. It was a way to discover a new cultur, to learn how to speak English, and to be more independent. I learn a lot there, about myself and about people.

				<h2>Watching TV 🖥</h2>

		  		<p>
		  			Watching TV show or movies is for me a way to learn, not only be entertained. Everytime I watch something, I get educated from it. I always try to understand the point of view of each charactere and learn from actions and informations.
